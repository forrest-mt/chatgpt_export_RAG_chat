Setup folders and files
uv init

Setup virtual environment in python
uv venv

Activate the virtual environment in python
source .venv/bin/activate

Add dependencies into pyproject.toml file

## Next Steps for Your Project:

### 1. Set Up Virtual Environment
Since you already have a `pyproject.toml` file, let's create a virtual environment:

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory (you're already there)
cd "/Users/michaeltrang/Documents/Coding Projects/AI Builders Bootcamp/Homework 3"

# Create a virtual environment
uv venv

# Activate it (on macOS)
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 2. Add Your Dependencies
Based on your PRD, you'll need several packages. Let's add them to your `pyproject.toml`:

```bash
<code_block_to_apply_changes_from>
```

# Add the main dependencies you mentioned
uv add llama-index
uv add gradio
uv add chromadb
uv add jupyter
uv add ollama

### 3. Install Everything
```bash
# Install all dependencies
uv sync
```



### 4. Verify Setup
```bash
# Check that everything installed correctly
uv pip list
```

## What This Will Give You:

- **LlamaIndex**: For RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) - creating embeddings and semantic search
- **Gradio**: For your web UI to journal and interact with your system
- **ChromaDB**: Vector database to store your embeddings
- **Jupyter**: For development and experimentation
- **Ollama**: To run local LLMs (like Gemma) for privacy

## Your Development Workflow:

1. **Start with Jupyter** for experimentation:
   ```bash
   uv run jupyter notebook
   ```

2. **Test your setup** by creating a simple script to verify imports work

3. **Begin with data processing** - converting your ChatGPT JSON/HTML to chunks

4. **Build incrementally** - start with embeddings, then RAG, then UI

## Pro Tips for Learning:
- Use `uv run python script.py` to run scripts in your virtual environment
- Keep your `.venv` folder in `.gitignore` (don't commit it)
- Start small - maybe just get one piece working at a time
- Use Jupyter notebooks to experiment before writing full scripts

Would you like me to help you with any specific part of this setup, or do you want to start with a particular component of your system?

Perfect! Now I can see your project goals. You're building a personal journal/chat analysis system using RAG. Let's start with the first step - processing your ChatGPT data. Here's what to do next:

## Next Steps After Jupyter Setup:

### 1. **Start Jupyter Notebook**
```bash
# Make sure you're in your project directory and virtual environment is activated
uv run jupyter notebook
```

### 2. **Create Your First Notebook**
- Create a new notebook called `01_data_processing.ipynb`
- This will be where you start processing your ChatGPT data

### 3. **First Steps in the Notebook**

#### Step 1: Test Your Imports
```python
# Test that all your packages work
import json
import pandas as pd
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import chromadb
from llama_index.core import VectorStoreIndex, SimpleDirectoryReader
from llama_index.vector_stores.chroma import ChromaVectorStore
from llama_index.embeddings.huggingface import HuggingFaceEmbedding
import ollama
```

#### Step 2: Load Your ChatGPT Data
```python
# Load your ChatGPT HTML file
with open('/Users/michaeltrang/Downloads/a218c220c2066baada92d8460d4cf2c17c68b814ec6872c57f6c4c7d78688a33-2025-09-04-19-20-27-9d38b4df3f2246e58a2c659e644f1802/chat.html', 'r') as f:
    html_content = f.read()

# Parse the HTML
soup = BeautifulSoup(html_content, 'html.parser')
print("HTML loaded successfully!")
```

#### Step 3: Explore the Data Structure
```python
<code_block_to_apply_changes_from>
```

### 4. **Your Development Workflow**

1. **Start Small**: Just get the data loading and parsing working first
2. **Explore**: Understand the structure of your ChatGPT export
3. **Chunk**: Break conversations into manageable pieces
4. **Embed**: Create embeddings for semantic search
5. **Store**: Save to ChromaDB
6. **Query**: Test semantic search
7. **UI**: Build the Gradio interface

### 5. **Recommended Notebook Structure**
Create these notebooks in order:
- `01_data_processing.ipynb` - Parse and explore your data
- `02_embeddings_and_storage.ipynb` - Create embeddings and store in ChromaDB
- `03_rag_queries.ipynb` - Test semantic search and RAG
- `04_gradio_ui.ipynb` - Build the web interface
- `05_integration.ipynb` - Put it all together

### 6. **Start with This Simple Test**
In your first notebook cell:
```python
# Test basic functionality
print("Testing imports...")
import json
import pandas as pd
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
print("✅ Basic imports work!")

# Test your data file
import os
data_file = '/Users/michaeltrang/Downloads/a218c220c2066baada92d8460d4cf2c17c68b814ec6872c57f6c4c7d78688a33-2025-09-04-19-20-27-9d38b4df3f2246e58a2c659e644f1802/chat.html'
if os.path.exists(data_file):
    print("✅ Data file found!")
else:
    print("❌ Data file not found")
```

Would you like me to help you with any specific part of this process, or do you want to start with the data exploration first?
